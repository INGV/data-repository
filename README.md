# INGV data-repository
The aim of this project is to design and implement a **data repository** in order to equip the Institute with a tool that, together with the [Open Data Portal]{https://data.ingv.it}, is able to provide INGV researchers and technologists with a complete tool for the _publication_ and _traceability_ of research data, in line with the principles of the [FAIRness]{https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/} of scientific research and [institutional data policy]{https://data.ingv.it/docs/principles/}.
